                The PACWEST Volleyball Championships is a volleyball event involving multiple post-secondary institutions in British Columbia. This year (2024), Douglas College hosted the championship, automatically entering both the women's and men's volleyball teams into the event. I designed and developed a visual identity for the event's print and digital materials, including posters, score tempaltes, and ID badges.

                A sports bracket was required for both 6 ft x 3ft and 4 ft x 2ft prints. A sports bracket is a visual representation of the winners of each match. Brackets show who won between two teams, which leads to the next match between those winners. The blank squares were filled during the event with stickers of the logos.

                Physical posters were designed to be put up around campus, promoting the event and showcasing some
                of the athletes participating. The athletes were in a way to create a slight curve towards the
                right. This was to give the column of athletes more visual interest, and allow plenty of space for
                the athletes holding volleyballs.

                The first draft was my initial take of the event: professional and clean, and dramatic. The contrast of the text and background colours weren't as strong, and the proportions of the athletes  in relation to each other weren't fully developed yet.

                The second draft involved a change of the top right athlete due to team roster changes. I also
                changed all the text and icons to white to be cohesive with the PACWEST championships
                logo.

                After feedback, the poster became more casual with a change to a simple line of text on
                the bottom bar, and the relocation and resizing of the date and location. The background was also
                changed to green to align with the athletic programâ€™s branding colours.

                Double sided ID badges were designed to be worn by staff, athletes (left), and VIP members. The
                challenge was to fit lots of information on the back, while staying brief yet understandable in the
                dates and times. I used hierarchy and blocking of information to achieve this.

    <div class="mini-headers">Reflection</div>
    <p class="reflection-text">
        Use imagery. Show athletes, logos, patterns, use as much as necessary, because people want to see that over lots of text. Instagram was a great indicator of this; there was more engagement and comments on the event announcement post with the poster because athletes were included in the graphic.
        <br><br>
        I also expanded my knowledge in designing smaller merch, such as the ID badges. The badges were approximately 4 x 6 inches, and I often overestimated how large I needed to make the text. I wasn't confident that the schedule information was readable, as it was very condensed into a small section. However, when seeing the physical copies of the badges, I was pleasantly surprised to see how readable the text was. Now, I have a clear understanding of how using measuring tools in real life can help greatly with determining how graphics will look on paper.
        <br><br>
        I learned that creating graphics for a large events to be perceived by many requires a recognizable and consistent visual branding, involving colours, typography, and layout of elements. It helps the people attending the event to be able to automatically group pieces of media together with similar visual branding.
