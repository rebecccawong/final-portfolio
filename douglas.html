                Promotional media was needed for various social media such as Twitter and Instagram. Our goal was to
                feature many student athletes to boost engagement and shares for our posts. We also wanted key
                information such as the dates and location of the championships to be clearly visible.

                Adapted for a smartphone, the sports bracket was designed for both men’s and women’s volleyball
                championships. The goal was to make the bracket easy to read and digest by using common bracket
                design features such as squares of logos and lines to connect the teams to the games they’d play.
                The challenge was to still keep that familiarity, while making it accessible for phone sizes. The
                digital program guide was designed to be viewed on a mobile device.

                Physical posters were designed to be put up around campus, promoting the event and showcasing some
                of the athletes participating. The athletes were in a awy to create a slight curve towards the
                right. This was to give the column of athletes more visual interest, and allow plenty of space for
                the left athletes holding out the volleyball.

                The first draft was my initial take of the event: professional and clean, and dramatic. I focused on
                making clear hierarchy and creating a clear eyeline, from the date and logo, to the athletes, to the
                stream, then the location and social medias at the bottom. I also wanted to choose images that were
                all different from each other, showcased an equal number of athletes from the men’s and women’s
                teams, and took up a good amount of space on the page.

                The second draft involved a change of the top right athlete due to team roster changes. I also
                changed all the text and icons to white to be cohesive with the PACWEST championships
                logo.<br><br>After feedback, the poster became more casual with a change to a simple line of text on
                the bottom bar, and the relocation and resizing of the date and location. The background was also
                changed to green to align with the athletic program’s branding colours.

                A large bracket was required for both 6 ft x 3ft and 4 ft x 2ft prints. They were put up in the
                athletes hotel and the event’s gym entrance. The blank squares were filled during the event with
                stickers of the logos. The seed number was also requested to be featured with the team’s logo.

                Double sided ID badges were designed to be worn by staff, athletes (left), and VIP members. The
                challenge was to fit lots of information on the back, while staying brief yet understandable in the
                dates and times. I used hierarchy and blocking of information to achieve this.

                    A program guide of the team’s rosters, brackets, and sponsors, was designed in Adobe InDesign.
                    Keeping with the same theme of the poster, the backgrounds of the pages alternate between a
                    light and dark sprayed deign. The program guide condenses each team into individual pages. It
                    was a challenge to fit lots of information onto a single page. I didn't want to list of athletes
                    to take up too much space or interfere too much with the rest of the page's hierarchy.

        Use imagery. Show athletes, logos, patterns, use as much as necessary, because people generally want to see that over lots of text. Instagram was a great indicator of this, there was more engagement and comments on a post when athletes were included in the graphic, such as the event poster and final scores. I also expanded my knowledge in designing smaller merch, such as the ID badges. The badges were approxamitaly 4 x 6 inches, and I often overestimated how large I needed to make the text. I wasn't confident that the schedule informattion was readable, as it was condensed quite a bit into a small section. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see how readable the text was. I learned that using measuring tools in real life help greatly with determining how graphics will look on paper.
        <br><br>
        Creating graphics for a large events to be perceived by many requires a recognizable and consistent visual
        branding, involving colours, typography, and layout of elements. I practiced this heavily by creating many
        different graphics with the same elements, and still making them unique and not monotonous.
